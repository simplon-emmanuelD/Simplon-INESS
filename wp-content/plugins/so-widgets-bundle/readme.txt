Widgets are great. No matter where you’re using them. In a [Page Builder](http://siteorigin.com/page-builder/) page or on your widgetized areas.

The SiteOrigin widget bundle gives you a collection of widgets that you can use and customize. All the widgets are built on our powerful framework, giving you advanced forms, unlimited colours and 1500+ icons.

The collection is growing, but here’s what we have so far.

* Google Maps Widget that's going places.
* Button Widget that you’ll love to click.
* Image Widget that’ll let you add images everywhere.
* Call To Action Widget that’ll get your users performing the actions you want.
* Slider Widget that slides images and HTML5 videos.
* Price Table Widget that’ll help you sell more.
* Post Carousel Widget that displays your posts as a carousel.
* Features Widget that lets you display a set of site or service features.
* Video Widget to get your videos out there.
* Headline Widget to get you noticed.
* Social Links Widget to show you're active.

Once you enable a widget, you'll be able to use it anywhere standard widgets are used. You can manage your widgets by going to Plugins > SiteOrigin Widgets in your WordPress admin.
